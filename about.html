          Founded officially in October of 2018, the society known as Posh
          Draughts is perhaps best described as a faction in the world of chess;
          a haven for purists of the game this is most certainly not. Comprising
          a rag-tag cluster of charlatans, pariahs and pillocks, the
          Swindon-centric group (which also includes members based in London,
          Southampton and
          <a id="karben" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karben">Karben</a>)
          has played host to some truly baffling encounters, both over-the-board
          and by correspondence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The club is defined by chaos, whether in the woeful organisation of
          events administered by Desmond 'So Des' Torpey, or the incredible
          blunders seen so often in the games themselves. However, it is evident
          that this very disorder is what makes the group such a potent magnet
          for the provincial chess mavericks it embraces, and hence why its
          numbers have swelled so drastically (from 4 to 12) in such a short
          time. This is an environment in which your Darrell Rocks, your Mark
          Nichollses, your Steve Wellses and your Andy Morses - players
          otherwise consigned ignominiously to the game's figurative scrapheap -
          can thrive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though, of course, frowned-upon by the chesstablishment, the group
          offers fans a level of entertainment previously unseen in the chess
          universe. While Magnus Carlsen may tantalise with the spectacle of
          almost-godlike tactical nous, such clinical displays cannot compare to
          the thrill of witnessing yet another queen needlessly relinquished as
          John Kane fails to notice a lingering bishop.
        </p>

        <p>
          In-fighting, bad blood and poor sportsmanship are commonplace, but
          with this all comes unpredictability, calamity, and compelling
          nonsense. In short: an absolute car crash of a group.
